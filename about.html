    <h1>About Me</h1>
  </header>

 <p>Hello! My name is Amy Russell, and I’m a faith-driven photographer with a passion for God and photography. I love capturing the beauty He places in every moment.</p>

<p>I grew up in Lewisville, where I attended a private Christian school that deeply shaped my faith and grounded my love for Christ. After graduating from college, I returned to the very school where I was nurtured, eager to share that same love of Christ with the next generation of students.</p>

<p>My journey in photography began in my sophomore year of college when I received my first camera. I quickly fell in love with capturing moments, starting with photos of my sister and friends. Over time, my passion grew into a purpose: I aim to create photos that reflect the beauty of Christ’s creation and tell heartfelt, meaningful stories through every image.</p>
